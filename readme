RUST BASIC
==========

    Basic data structures and algorithms in Rust.

    The project is used for practice with Rust programming language in the
    following aspects: grammar, safe code, unsafe code, memory management,
    and supported tools.

    Data structures and algorithms are grouped and built into containers. For
    examples: Stack, Queue, Vector, String, HashMap, HashSet, Tree,
    PriorityQueue, RedBlackTree, DirectedGraph and more. All implementations are
    madeÂ from scratch without dependencies, except for: 1 - `std::ptr` and
    `std::alloc` to manage memory; 2 - `std::iter` to implement standard
    iterators; 3 - `std::cmp` to implement comparison operators.

QUICKSTART
==========

    # Install Rust compiler and tools.
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

    # Read the document for quick API references.
    cargo doc --open

    # Run unit tests.
    cargo test

MEMORY DIAGNOSTIC
=================

    # Install `cargo-valgrind`.
    cargo install cargo-valgrind@2.1.0

    # Make sure `valgrind` is available in the environment because
    # `cargo-valgrind` depend on it.

    # Start checking.
    cargo valgrind test
